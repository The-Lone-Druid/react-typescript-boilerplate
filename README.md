# Getting Started with React Typescript Boilerplate?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Boilerplate Setup

Firstly clone or download the repository
and then

### `npm install`

To download all the necessary packages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

### `npm run build:prod`

### `npm run build:stag`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
To run above commands you'll need to create seperate .env files liek .env.prod .env.stag where
you'll specify the API Key's, BaseURL, Endpoints etc...
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
